#: I LIKE
#: absolute_paths_linter: checks that no absolute paths are used

#: closed_curly_linter: check that closed curly braces should always be on their own line unless they follow an else.
#: object_usage_linter: checks that closures have the proper usage using checkUsage - Note this runs eval on the code, so do not use with untrusted code.

#: MEH
#: commented_code_linter: checks that there is no commented code outside roxygen blocks (not sure what this does, is it only for .Rmd?)
#: multiple_dots_linter: check that objects do not have.multiple.dots.
#: object_length_linter: check that objects do are not very long

#: MODIFY THESE
#: line_length_linter: check the line length of both comments and code is less than length (I like ~120)
#: open_curly_linter: check that opening curly braces are never on their own line and are always followed by a newline.

#: I DON'T LIKE
#: commas_linter: check that all commas are followed by spaces, but do not have spaces before them.
